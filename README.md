# randomforest-electricity-forecast
This project is about predicting electricity demand in Texas using public data. The project involves developing a machine learning model based on regression trees and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain the decisions made by the regression trees. This will help in understanding the factors influencing electricity demand and make the model's predictions more transparent and interpretable

Objectives and goals：Predict electricity demand in Texas

Methodology: Developing a machine learning model based on regression trees and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain the decisions made by these regression trees. 

Results and key findings: Achieving a 95% R²

visualizations: Heatmap of their relationships

Individual contributions: Clean the data and build the model, prompt engineering
